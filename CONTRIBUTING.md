## Scope of Contributions

Contributions are accepted for enhancements to the portfolio itself, including:

- Bug reports and feature suggestions  
- Code improvements (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- Design updates (layout, animations)  
- Internationalization or translations  
- Documentation refinement or correction

---

## Reporting Issues

Before opening a pull request (PR), please:

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.  
- Create a new issue if none match.  
  - Provide a clear title and detailed description.  
  - Include screenshots, error messages, or steps to replicate bugs.

Issues are required before submitting a PR so I can evaluate and assign tasks clearly — this streamlines collaboration.

---

## Proposing Changes (Pull Requests)

Once your issue is opened and assigned:

1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-header-bug`, `feat-translate-es`).  
3. Implement your changes; commit often with meaningful messages.  
4. Open a PR referencing the related issue (e.g., “Addresses issue #12”).  
5. Clearly summarize the problem, solution, and testing done.

## Development Workflow

- **Fork** the repo.  
- **Branch** off `main` using a descriptive name.  
- **Commit** logically and cleanly.  
- **Submit PR** once ready, referencing the issue.

Focused, incremental PRs are preferred — this eases review and testing :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

## Review and Merge Process

- I (Tinotenda Mhedziso) personally review all PRs.  
- Typical review time: **1–2 days**, occasionally up to **7 days**.  
- Feedback may include requests for adjustments.  
- Merge occurs once the changes meet quality and scope expectations.

Be patient—if you haven’t heard back after 7 days, a courteous reminder is fine.
